I am a first-year PhD student in [Transportation Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/) at the [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), supervised by [Dr. Hao Yang](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/faculty/dr-hao-yang/). I earned my master's degree in Robotics from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Yongsheng Ma](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/mays/en/). I also work closely with [Prof. Hongfei Xue](https://havocfixer.github.io/) from [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/) and [Prof. Sheng Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheng-Xu-8) from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.siat.cas.cn/).

My research focuses on the intersection of multi-vehicle systems, wireless sensing, and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on developing smart systems for intelligent transportation and traffic management.
