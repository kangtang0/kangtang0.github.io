Ma, "Optimal Sensor Placement Using Combinations of Hybrid Measurements for Source Localization," 2024 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf24), Denver, CO, USA, 2024, pp. 1-6, doi: [10.1109/RadarConf2458775.2024.10548509](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10548509).
  * This paper focuses on static source localization employing different combinations of measurements, including time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), received-signal-strength (RSS), angle-of-arrival (AOA), and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. Since sensor-source geometry significantly impacts localization accuracy, the strategies of optimal sensor placement are proposed systematically using combinations of hybrid measurements. Firstly, the relationship between sensor placement and source estimation accuracy is formulated by a derived Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). Secondly, the A-optimality criterion, i.e., minimizing the trace of the CRB, is selected to calculate the smallest reachable estimation mean-squared-error (MSE) in a unified manner. Thirdly, the optimal sensor placement strategies are developed to achieve the optimal estimation bound. Specifically, the specific constraints of the optimal geometries deduced by specific measurements, i.e., TDOA, AOA, RSS, and TOA, are found and discussed theoretically. Finally, the new findings are verified by simulation studies.
* Kang Tang, Sheng Xu, Yuqi Yang, and Yongsheng Ma. "Optimal Sensor Placement Using Decentralized TDOA Sensor Network in Target Localization" (submitted to IEEE WCL, under review).
  * This paper concerns the optimal sensor placement strategy for target localization using measurements collected from a novel decentralized TDOA system. Most existing works adopt a centralized TDOA system, where one sensor is chosen as the common reference. We consider a decentralized sensor system to acquire TDOA measurements for target localization. By minimizing the trace of the inverse Fisher information matrix (FIM), a new optimal sensor placement strategy is developed in two scenarios. We derive the smallest reachable trace of the Cramér–Rao lower bound with the corresponding optimal sensor-target geometries. The observations are concluded in two remarks, which are used to evaluate and improve the estimation accuracy. We use simulation examples to verify the results.
* A first-author paper to be submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. "Frame Theory for Optimal Sensor Placement Using 3D Hybrid RSS-TOA-AOA Measurements in Source Localization."
  * The sensor–target placement plays a pivotal role in improving the localization accuracy; the commonly used evaluation function for this problem is built by Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) or Fisher information matrix (FIM). Frame theory, which was developed recently, can provide a more easily tractable evaluation function, especially for some complex cases. In this letter, we derive an optimal sensor placement strategy by frame theory and prove its equivalence with the method by CRLB and FIM. For the hybrid angle-of-arrival (AOA), received-signal-strength (RSS) and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements based localization system, we also present the optimal sensor augmentation problem with a fixed sensor and a new sensor and for arbitrary but fixed distances between the new sensor and the target. The conclusions are verified by several simulations.
